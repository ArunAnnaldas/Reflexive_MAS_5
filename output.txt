📌 User Request: Write a function to check if a number is prime

🔧 Step 1: Planner Agent...
/Users/dummyUser/Documents/Learning/AgenticAI/5_Reflexive_MAS/main.py:15: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The method `BaseChatModel.__call__` was deprecated in langchain-core 0.1.7 and will be removed in 1.0. Use :meth:`~invoke` instead.
  return llm(messages).content
1. Define the function with a parameter for the number to be checked.
2. Check if the number is less than 2, return False as prime numbers are greater than 1.
3. Iterate from 2 to the square root of the number (rounded up) to check for factors.
4. If the number is divisible by any number in the range, return False as it is not a prime number.
5. If no factors are found, return True as the number is a prime number.

💻 Step 2: Coder Agent (Initial Attempt)...
```python
import math

def is_prime(number):
    if number < 2:
        return False
    
    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(number) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```

🧐 Critic Agent (Attempt 1)...
1. The code is well-written and follows PEP 8 styling conventions.
2. The function `is_prime` correctly checks if a number is prime or not.
3. The use of `math.isqrt(number)` is efficient for finding the square root of the number.

Improvement suggestions:
1. It would be good to add some comments to explain the logic behind the prime number checking algorithm for better understanding.
2. Consider adding input validation to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

Overall, the code is good and can be APPROVED.

✅ Code approved by Critic. Final version:
```python
import math

def is_prime(number):
    if number < 2:
        return False
    
    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(number) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```
